# Producer consumer simple app

> Create program in Java language that will process commands from FIFO queue using Producer – Consumer pattern.
Supported commands are the following:
<br> Add  - adds a user into a database
<br> PrintAll – prints all users into standard output
<br> DeleteAll – deletes all users from database

> User is defined as database table SUSERS with columns (USER_ID, USER_GUID, USER_NAME)
Demonstrate program on the following sequence (using main method or test):
<br> Add (1, "a1", "Robert")
<br> Add (2, "a2", "Martin")
<br> PrintAll
<br> DeleteAll
<br> PrintAll

> Show your ability to unit test code on at least one class.
Goal of this exercise is to show Java language and JDK know-how, OOP principles, clean code understanding, concurrent programming knowledge, unit testing experience.
Please do not use Spring framework in this exercise. Embedded database is sufficient.
